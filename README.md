# simon_game

Basic web application replicating the classic SimonÂ® game. It has two modes; 'normal' and 'strict' mode. When the user presses a wrong button out of order, the game will replay the sequence again until the user can get the correct sequence (Normal Mode). When the strict button is toggled on the user must get the sequence correct every turn or it will start over from the beginning. The user wins once they can surpass 20 sequence additions.
